# bitbucket-pullrequests-chrome-extension
Chrome extension that extends the capabilities of default bitbucket repository pull requests overview. It adds the list of reviewers and list of tasks to each pull request. This means that user doesn't need to click on each pull request separately to examine list of reviewers and/or tasks.
